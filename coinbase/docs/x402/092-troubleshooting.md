# Troubleshooting

Fixes for the errors that come up most often when integrating x402 with CDP.

## Before you debug

Four things resolve most reports, and they are faster to check than to read about:

1. **Which environment.** `CdpX402Client` and `createX402Server` default to `"production"`, which
   means mainnet and real funds. Omitting the option is not the same as running in development.
2. **Which network.** The CAIP-2 identifier has to match on both sides. A client registered for
   `eip155:8453` cannot pay a route that only accepts `eip155:84532`.
3. **The balance.** Confirm the payer holds the token the route asks for, on that network.
4. **The credentials.** Sellers need `CDP_API_KEY_ID` and `CDP_API_KEY_SECRET` for the
   facilitator. `CDP_WALLET_SECRET` is only required if the SDK provisions an API Key
   Wallet to receive (or if you are a buyer paying with `CdpX402Client`).

Then read the `error` field in the server's JSON response before anything else. It usually names the
failure directly, and the codes are explained under
[Error code reference](#error-code-reference).

## Payment fails or the 402 persists

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The endpoint still returns 402 after I attach a payment">
    The server rejected the payment rather than ignoring it, so the reason is in the response body.
    The usual causes, in rough order of frequency:

    * The payer's balance is too low, or holds the right token on the wrong network.
    * The client and the route have no network and scheme in common. `CdpX402Client` registers Base
      `exact`, EVM `upto`, and EVM-only `auth-capture` by default. Add other EVM networks or Solana
      (`exact` and `upto`) through `networkSchemes`.
    * The amount does not match. The `exact` scheme requires equality on EVM, so neither
      underpayment nor overpayment settles.
    * The authorization expired before it reached the facilitator.
    * The payer was declined by compliance screening. See
      [A payment was declined by screening](#settlement-problems).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No scheme registered">
    The client or the server never registered a handler for the scheme and network combination the
    payment needs.

    On TypeScript this is rare, because `CdpX402Client` and `createX402Server` register their
    supported defaults for you. Add non-default EVM networks or Solana (`exact` and `upto`) through
    `networkSchemes` on the client. On Python there are no defaults, so every scheme is registered
    by hand, and this error means one was missed. It also appears when a plain network name is
    passed where a CAIP-2 identifier is expected, since `base` and `eip155:8453` do not match as
    strings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="invalid_payload or a schema validation failure">
    The payload reached the facilitator but did not match the expected shape. Check, in order:

    * **Protocol version.** A v1 client against a v2 server produces exactly this error. The
      giveaway is `X-PAYMENT` in the request instead of `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.
    * **Mixed package versions.** The `@x402` packages release in lockstep, so a stale `@x402/evm`
      against a current `@x402/core` can send a payload the server rejects. Upgrade them together.
    * **Price format.** Route prices are strings such as `"$0.01"`, not numbers.
    * **The signature itself.** A wrong chain ID or an expired `validBefore` fails validation
      rather than producing a signature error.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Signing fails in Python">
    `ExactEvmScheme` expects an x402 signer, and an `eth_account` object declares `sign_typed_data`
    differently. The scheme wraps an `eth_account` object in `EthAccountSigner` for you, so a
    signing failure here usually means the object you passed is neither — a raw key, a viem-style
    account, or a custom class. Pass a CDP account through `EvmLocalAccount` first. The working
    setup is in [step 2 of the buyer quickstart](/x402/buyer/quickstart#2-write-the-client).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## It works on testnet but fails on mainnet

Four things change when you move, and any one of them produces a failure that looks like a broken
integration:

* **The environment flag.** `"production"` is the default, so an integration that worked on testnet
  had `environment: "development"` set explicitly somewhere. Removing it is what moves you to
  mainnet, and forgetting to remove it is what keeps you on testnet.
* **The network identifiers.** Base is `eip155:8453`, not `eip155:84532`. On Python, where there is
  no environment switch, every registration has to be updated by hand.
* **The balance.** Testnet USDC does not exist on mainnet. Fund the payer with real USDC on the
  network the route accepts.
* **The client's networks.** `CdpX402Client` registers Base mainnet in production and Base Sepolia
  in development. Add Polygon, Arbitrum, World, or Solana (`exact` and `upto`) through
  `networkSchemes` in either environment.

See
[Choose your environment](/x402/seller/production-configuration#choose-your-environment) for the
seller-side configuration.

## Settlement problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Settlement timed out. Should I retry?">
    Yes. A timed-out settle can still have landed onchain, but retrying the same authorization
    cannot charge the buyer a second time: the `exact` scheme's authorization nonce is single-use, so
    the facilitator rejects the replay with `invalid_payload`. Every scheme has an equivalent
    protection.

    That reply is ambiguous on its own, though, because it looks the same whether the first attempt
    settled or the payload was bad to begin with. To learn what actually happened, take the
    transaction reference from the timed-out response and look it up on the network with
    `eth_getTransactionReceipt` or the Solana equivalent. A confirmed transaction is a completed
    payment, and no transaction reference means nothing was broadcast.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="A payment was declined by screening">
    The CDP Facilitator screens every payment against sanctions lists and Know Your Transaction risk
    signals, checking the payer and the recipient. A declined payment returns `kyt_risk_detected`
    with a `403`, so nothing moves onchain and the buyer keeps their funds. Screening runs at both
    verification and settlement.

    This is not retryable. An address was declined rather than a request, so the same buyer is
    declined again until they pay from a different account. If you believe an address was declined
    incorrectly, raise it in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cdp).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="A buyer may have been charged twice">
    A single authorization cannot settle twice on Base or Solana, so start by working out which of
    two different things happened.

    If the payment payloads were identical across the requests, the likely story is that the first
    settlement failed and the retry succeeded, which is one charge rather than two. If the payloads
    differed, the buyer signed twice, and the usual reason is a client paying again to regain access
    to a resource it had already paid for.

    That second case is a design problem rather than a bug, and there are two extensions that fix
    it. `payment-identifier` gives the client an idempotency key, so a repeated request returns the
    original response instead of asking for payment again. `sign-in-with-x` gives the caller a
    provable identity that persists across requests, so your server can recognize a returning buyer
    and serve what they already bought. Neither is prescribed by the CDP SDK, so you configure them
    by hand.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Discovery problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My endpoint is missing from the Bazaar">
    Run the [validation endpoint](/x402/seller/get-discovered#validate-your-endpoint) first. It
    identifies the missing requirement faster than working through the checklist by hand.

    An endpoint has to be served over public HTTPS, return valid Bazaar metadata on a `402`, and
    have settled at least one payment through the CDP Facilitator. Endpoints on localhost, behind
    an authenticating proxy, or reachable only over plain HTTP are not indexed.

    On the settlement call that triggers indexing, set both `paymentPayload.extensions.bazaar` and
    `paymentPayload.resource`.

    If all of that holds, give it time. Indexing runs after the settled payment and takes up to 15
    minutes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I read the validation response?">
    `valid` is the summary, and the fields under it explain how it was reached.

    * `preflight` lists what was checked before any simulated payment. It separates failures, which
      block indexing, from advisory recommendations, which do not.
    * `bazaarExtension` reports whether your discovery metadata was found and parsed.
    * `simulation.outcome` is the result of a simulated payment. `accepted` is the success signal.

    A response with `valid: true` and advisory recommendations will be indexed, but agents may
    struggle to call it. Recommendations are usually about missing input schemas.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

For indexing behavior itself, including the `EXTENSION-RESPONSES` header, route consolidation,
ranking refresh timing, and removal for inactivity, see
[Troubleshooting discovery](/x402/seller/get-discovered#troubleshooting-discovery).

## Error code reference

The facilitator returns a reason string on every rejection: `invalidReason` when verification fails,
`errorReason` when settlement fails. The codes below are the ones the CDP Facilitator returns in
practice, which is a smaller set than the x402 specification defines.

### Any payment

| Code | Status | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| `insufficient_funds` | 400 | The payer's balance is below the amount required. |
| `invalid_payload` | 400 | The payload is malformed, fails validation, or reuses a spent authorization. |
| `invalid_scheme` | 400 | The payload's scheme is not one the route accepts. |
| `invalid_network` | 400 | The network in the payload is not one the route accepts. |
| `invalid_amount` | 400 | The amount could not be parsed, or is not a positive value. |
| `amount_too_low` | 400 | The payment is below the minimum amount the facilitator will settle. |
| `self_send_not_allowed` | 400 | The payer and the recipient are the same address. |
| `kyt_risk_detected` | 403 | The payer or the recipient was declined by compliance screening. |
| `request_blocked_by_location` | 403 | The request came from a jurisdiction the facilitator does not serve. |
| `permit2_disabled` | 400 | The payment needs Permit2, which is not enabled for that token or network. |
| `preflight_validation_failed` | 400 | A check that runs before the scheme sees the payment failed. |
| `invalid_bazaar_extension` | 400 | The Bazaar discovery metadata on the `402` is malformed. |
| `unsupported_payload_type` | 400 | The payload type is not one the facilitator handles. |
| `unknown_error` | 500 | The failure could not be classified. Report these. |

`invalid_payload` is the catch-all, so it covers more than a malformed body. A reused authorization
nonce, a failed onchain simulation, and a recipient that does not match the route all arrive as
`invalid_payload`.

### EVM `exact` payments

| Code | Meaning |
| - | - |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_signature` | The signature does not recover to the payer address. |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_authorization_value` | The amount does not exactly match the amount required. |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_authorization_valid_before` | The authorization expired before settlement. |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_authorization_valid_after` | The authorization is not valid yet. |
| `invalid_exact_evm_payload_undeployed_smart_wallet` | The payer is a counterfactual smart wallet with no deployment data. |
| `smart_wallet_deployment_failed` | Deploying the payer's smart wallet during settlement failed. |

Tokens that settle through Permit2 add a parallel family prefixed
`invalid_exact_evm_permit2_payload_`, covering `signature`, `amount`, `deadline`, `recipient`,
`spender`, `valid_after`, and `allowance_required`. `allowance_required` is the one to know: it means
the one-time Permit2 approval has not been granted yet.

### Solana `exact` payments

Solana rejections are prefixed `invalid_exact_svm_payload_transaction`, with about twenty variants
that name the specific instruction or account at fault. The ones that come up most are
`invalid_exact_svm_payload_transaction_simulation_failed`,
`invalid_exact_svm_payload_transaction_sender_ata_not_found` when the payer has no associated token
account for the asset, and `invalid_exact_svm_payload_transaction_amount_mismatch`.

### Settlement only

| Code | Meaning |
| - | - |
| `settle_exact_failed_onchain` | The settlement transaction was submitted and reverted. |
| `settle_exact_node_failure` | The facilitator could not reach the network to submit or confirm. |
| `settle_exact_svm_transaction_confirmation_timed_out` | The Solana transaction was submitted but did not confirm in time. |
| `settle_exact_svm_block_height_exceeded` | The Solana transaction expired before confirmation. |
| `invalid_exact_evm_verification_failed` | Verification, rerun at settlement time, no longer passes. |

The last three are the ones worth handling deliberately, because the payment may or may not have
landed. Resolve them by confirming the transaction rather than by retrying.

Other schemes carry their own codes. `batch-settlement` defines a large family prefixed
`invalid_batch_settlement_evm_`. EVM `upto` surfaces failures through `invalid_payload`, while
Solana `upto` defines `invalid_upto_svm_` codes for payment requirements, payload, channel, and
settlement failures, plus `settle_upto_svm_` codes for onchain and confirmation failures.

## Getting help

For product and integration questions rather than errors, start with the
[FAQ](/x402/support/faq). For anything else, the CDP Discord and the protocol and SDK issue
trackers are listed under
[Community and developer resources](/x402/support/community#get-help).

When you report a payment failure, include the CAIP-2 network, the scheme, the `error` field from
the response, and the transaction reference if one exists. Without those, the first reply will ask
for them.
