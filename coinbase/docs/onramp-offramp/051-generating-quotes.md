# Generating Quotes

## Onramp Quote

The Onramp Quote API provides clients with a quote based on the asset the user would like to purchase, the network they plan to purchase it on, the dollar amount of the payment, the payment currency, the payment method, and country of the user.

<Tip>
  We recommend using the new **[Create Onramp Session API](/api-reference/v2/rest-api/onramp/create-an-onramp-session)** which can return both onramp URL and quote in a single call.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Limitations

  The quote provided by this API is an estimate only. It does not guarantee that the user will be able to complete their purchase using the returned quote. Depending on fluctuations in network fees and exchange rates, and whether or not the user chooses the logged in or guest checkout experience, the actual fees charged may be different.
</Info>

Call the [Onramp Quote API](/api-reference/rest-api/onramp-offramp/create-buy-quote) to get a quote.
