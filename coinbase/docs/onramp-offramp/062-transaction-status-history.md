# Transaction Status & History

## Offramp Transaction Status

The Offramp Transaction Status API provides developers with a list of user Offramp transactions. Developers can poll the real time status of offramp transactions and show users a view of their Coinbase transactions made within the client app.

To link all transactions created during the session, developers must provide the (optional) field `partnerUserRef` as a query parameter when initializing Offramp.

Transaction Status returns a paginated list of all transactions from newest to oldest. If the client app doesn't have a concept of a user, clients can pass a random `partnerUserRef` to reference a one-off session.

There are two ways to get the transaction status:

1. Use the [fetchOnrampTransactionStatus](https://docs.base.org/builderkits/onchainkit/fund/fetch-onramp-transaction-status#fetchonramptransactionstatus) util to get the transaction status
2. Make a direct call to the API
